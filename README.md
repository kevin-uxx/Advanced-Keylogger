# Advanced-Keylogger
 It is an advanced keylogger that goes beyond basic keystroke logging. This open-source project provides a comprehensive monitoring solution with several additional features, including microphone activation, email delivery of logs, clipboard contents copying, and system information retrieval, including IP address.

Key Features
Keystroke Logging: It effectively logs all keyboard inputs made on the target device.

Microphone Activation: In addition to keystrokes, the keylogger can be configured to activate the device's microphone, allowing recording of ambient sounds and voice conversations.

Email Delivery: It ensures that the logged information is encrypted and securely sent to a designated email address, providing remote access to the collected data.

Clipboard Contents: The keylogger captures and records the contents of the clipboard, offering insights into copied texts and data.

System Information Retrieval: It can gather system information, including IP address, hostname, operating system details, and more, providing a comprehensive overview of the target device.
